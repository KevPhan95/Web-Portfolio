		<p class="wrapper">I graduated with a B.S. in Biology at <a href="https://www.sonoma.edu/" target="_blank"> Sonoma State
				University</a> and became a Chiropractic student shortly after. For the past 3 years I have been studying to become a Chiro and
			recently I became an intern where I worked under a mentor clinician while providing care for patients.</p>

      <p class="wrapper"><strong>As a Chiropractic intern I learned:</strong></p>
      <ul class="wrapper">
        <li>Teamwork makes the dreamwork</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid of the unknown. Embrace it and learn.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p class="wrapper">After 9 months I decided that it wasn't for me, so I left and enrolled to Thinkful to start my coding journey! I had always been fascinated by programming and am now excited to begin a new career in the field of tech.</p>
